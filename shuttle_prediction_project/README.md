This project predicts real-time shuttle delays by using traffic data from Google Maps, structural delay simulation, passenger density, and route information stored in FalkorDB. The system connects to FalkorDB to store and read shuttle stops and routes. If FalkorDB is not running, the code shows a connection error and continues without database operations. To use the database features, FalkorDB or Redis Stack must be running on port 6379. You can start it by running the redis-stack-server command or by using the Docker image for FalkorDB.

The program also uses the Google Maps API to retrieve live traffic durations. If the Google Maps API key is missing, the program still runs but traffic delays return as zero, which reduces accuracy. If the required Python libraries falkordb or googlemaps are not installed, the program prints an error message and does not continue until they are installed.

The code uses several Python features such as dataclasses for the data models (Stop, Route, Trip, LiveLocation), type annotations from the typing module, datetime and timedelta for time calculations, json for storing route sequences, random for simulating delays and passenger density, and try-except blocks to prevent crashes when external services fail.

When the program runs, it first loads the static stop and route data into FalkorDB. It then selects a route, generates a simulated live location, checks the scheduled arrival time, and calculates predicted delay by combining traffic delay, structural delay, and passenger-density-based delay. Finally, the program prints the predicted arrival time along with the delay summary.
